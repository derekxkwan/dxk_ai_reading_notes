## Summary
Learns hierarchical Markov mixture distributions to study changes in mode and pitch distribution in Renaissance music over time (cantus dataset) Given 8 modes (first latent variable) and 3 clusters per mode (second latent variable), achieve good classification (84\%) without internal clustering and 85.3\% with. Internal cluster show differences in "pitch-class transition probabilities" in modes 1,3,5 vs rest (so are "supra-modal groupings"). Show little change in genre (antiphon, reponsory, responsory verse) but show changes in internal cluster frequencies (so changes in pitch distribution).
