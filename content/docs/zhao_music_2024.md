## Summary
Creates a PTV (performance of theme and variation) dataset (Mozart, Beethoven, Haydn) of music ripped from YouTube combined with IMSLP scores with annotations of theme and variations. Calculates self-similarity matrices from chromagrams and tempograms and performs boundary detection using bidirectional dynammic programming on STFT based cosine distance (opposite of cosine similarity?) to find large (theme vs. variations) and small (phrases in antecedent-consequent phrasing) boundaries.
