## Summary
Curates a new dataset for Schenkerian analysis using 145 analyses from Ni-Hahn and 3 others. Utilizes a new convention using JSON that gives pitch names and hierarchical depths of notes among other data. Paper describes that it lends itself to hierarchical graph clusterings where surface level notes (each represented by a node, edges describe various types of relationships) can be associated to deeper depth nodes. 

## Key Contributions
New dataset for Schenkerian analysis using JSON and an app to contribute analyses. 

## Limitations and Future Work
More analyses needed.
