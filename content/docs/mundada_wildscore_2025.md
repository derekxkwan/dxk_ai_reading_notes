## Summary
Benchmark for multimodal LLMs to answer music theory questions based with pictures of musical scores. Several issues pop up in terms of LLMs being able to identify score parts and then also parse scorse into ABC notation. Dataset scraped from musictheory subreddit and includes QA such as harmony, texture, counterpoint
