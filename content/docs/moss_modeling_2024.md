## Summary
Studies US pop, Brazilian choro, and J-Pop harmonic trends over time. Learns prob distributions of 4-gram chord progressions (and substitution probabilities of individual chords) through EM. Entropy of J-Pop chords increases over time (more than other genres) and forms distinct clusters in substitutions (meaning unclear). US-pop substitution more clear with secondary dominants and relative subs (Gmin to Bb maj). Choro has three clusters.
