## Summary
Uses beat-algned chromagrams to create a 3rd-order tensor with dimensions corresponding to pitch, time (within bar), and bars. Performs non-negative tucker decomposition (keeping pitch latent dim same) using HALS (on slabs) and proximal gradient descent (on core tensor). Performed on Beatles dataset.
