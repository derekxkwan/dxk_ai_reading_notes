## Summary
Learns a symbolic music/piano roll DDPM model with classifier-free guidance and cross-attention from the POP909 dataset. Conditioning is done by VAE embeddings which learned a chord-texture (rhythm) disentangled latent space. Beat XLNet and VAE baselines on objective (pitch, duration distribution dist) and subjective metrics
