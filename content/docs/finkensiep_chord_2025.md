## Summary
(tone-profile vector for figuration tones: Dirichlet dist). Posterior distributions for tone-profile vectors are studied for differences between models trained on ABC+ (classical music) and EWLD (laed sheets). Mostly similar but ABC+ has more figuration prob (due to chord-scale theory for lead sheets) but EWLD has more ambuiguity in what is chord tone and what is figuration (due to melodies). Dominant chords tend to have more figuration (cadential, longer). EWLD has more enharmonic equivalences (treats dim chords enharmonics as same so all chord tones equal prob). Training is done inferring what is chord tone and what is figuration by figuration having neighbors whole-step at most away which are chord tones.
