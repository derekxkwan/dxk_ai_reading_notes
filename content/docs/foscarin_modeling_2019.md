## Summary
Develops rules for a probabilistic context-free grammar that determines the most intuitive way of notating rhythms in sheet music. Production rules subdivide an interval and terminals are 0 for no note or tie (from previous note) and 1 is note. Rules are learned from Music21 corpus and Enhanced Wikifonia Leadsheet dataset. Goal is smallest number of leaves. No results.
