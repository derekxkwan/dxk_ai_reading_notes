## Summary
Use linear regression on Tagtraum MSD annotated subset to characterize trends between mean pitch, total variation of pitch, and pitch class entropy of vocals over time and between genres (vocals extracted using PYIN from librosa). Rap has most TV (possibly due to "unpitched"?). Genres such as country and rock and folk and reaggae and jazz have positive relationship between mean pitch and year (mb due to female vocals?). Rap and RnB negative relationship. In general, less TV and PCE over time (authors conclude as less musical complexity).
