## Summary
vs Db).  CNN (granularity of 32nd note) is designed with more filters and smaller window at beginning to focus on immediate time steps with less filters and bigger windows later on. Does augmentation through transposition and "texturization" from Roman numeral ground truth (realize not as block chords but splitting off bass, voicing high voice first, alberti bass, and mixing all of them randomly). Experiments on Annotated Beethoven Corpus, Beethoven Piano Sonatas, Haydn Sun Quartets, Theme and Variation Encodings with Roman Numerals, When-in-Roman, WTC. On main tasks, more augmentation = better (except for inversion) and for roman numeral prediction, alt tasks did better than main tasks. AugN state of the art compared to Micchi model and Chen and Su model.
