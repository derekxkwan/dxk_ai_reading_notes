## Summary
Derives a probabilistic model of syncopation using Bayes rule. Through a series a human-studies experiments, concludes that hierarchical measures (Longuet-Higgins/Lee) have positive correlation, density (offbeatness, etc.) have negative correlation. Concludes probabilistic model simplistic and metric prior is prior (duple vs triple subdiv)
