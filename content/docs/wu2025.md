## Summary
Aligns text, audio, and symbolic music embeddings using a multilingual text encoder (XLM-R), symbolic music encoder (M3), and an audio encoder using embeddings from MERT-v1-95M. Curates the M4-RAG dataset with 2.31 million metadata entries, curated from Google searches converted into annotations by Qwen2.5-72B. Translation done by XLM-R and Qwen. Beats (MRR) CLAP and TTMR++ on audio retrieval task and older versions of CLaMP on symbolic retrieval. CLaMP 3 initialized from CLaMP 2 (symbolic) beats other CLamP on ABC and MIDI multilingual tasks, and CLaMP3 self-aligned beats pre-initalized version on audio multilingual tasks.

## Key Contributions
Contrastive multimodal models for audio, symbolic music, and text. M4-RAG multimodal multilingual dataset.


## Limitations and Future Work
Machine translations for multilinguality. Temporalty in embeddings a concern (embeddings take entirety of piece).
